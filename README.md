# Bayesian_synthesis

This repository contains files supporting the series of YouTube videos teaching Bayesian Tools for Synthesis of Ecological Data.  All of this material was produced with support from the National Science Foundation Award DEB 1753860 to Colorado State University.

There are four files of slides, one for each video

1) Introduction.pdf
2) MomentMatching.pdf
3) Priors_from_multiple_studies.pdf
4) Data_from_multiple_Studies

In addition, there is a extensive set of worked problems in the file MultiLevelModelingLab_for_Bayesian_Synthesis.html.  These problems are designed to reinforce the concepts in video 4. Problems are divided into sections that are accessed via the blue labeled tabs at the top of the top of the document. Executing some of these problems requires loading the R data sets NO2Emission.rda and SiteCarbon.rda.
